#Config file for the AutoPlant Plugin.
#Here you are able to change the in-game messages sent to the players while using the plugin*.

#*It is recommended that you keep the original messages for title formatting reasons.

#This field allows you to change the message when a crop is broken:
#Crop: "&2That crop isn't fully grown yet!"

#Once you have edited a title, be sure to reload the config using '/autoplant reload'.
#If you have any issue with the config file, you can delete the file, restart the server, and a new one will generated.
